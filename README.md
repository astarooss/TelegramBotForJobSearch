# TelegramBotForJobSearch
The bot was created by me at the beginning of my training, therefore it is not written very beautifully and conveniently, in the next versions I will finalize the code and make its use more convenient

Bot functionality for users:
 - The ability to add your vacancies that will also fall into the associated channel and chat
 - The ability to view current vacancies in the bot, both the newest and by profession
 
Bot functionality for administrators and developers
 - Moderation of chats, namely the addition of words or phrases that trigger the deletion of a message
 - Adding trigger words that respond to the user's message with a given text (advertising)
 - Admin panel
